# Apple TV Homescreen (Experimental)

This is an experimental implementation of my [apple-tv-card](https://github.com/marcreichel/apple-tv-card) project.

## Features

- Hover animation of the apps (thanks to my [apple-tv-card](https://github.com/marcreichel/apple-tv-card) package)
- Drag and drop apps around (thanks to the [muuri.js](https://github.com/haltu/muuri) package)
